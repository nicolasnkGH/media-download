# üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosted VPN & Media Stack

This is a **self-hosted media and torrent stack** designed to offer secure access to various services and applications using a **NordVPN** container with a **VPN network** setup. It integrates a variety of tools such as **qBittorrent**, **Overseerr**, **Tautulli**, **Jackett**, **Radarr**, **Sonarr**, and **Flaresolverr**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- A **NordVPN** account with an **API token**.
- Basic knowledge of **Docker** containers and networking.

### Configuration:
1. **NordVPN**: The stack is configured with NordVPN for secure access to all services. You'll need a valid **NordVPN token** and specify the desired **server location** and **connection technology** (NordLynx).
2. **Service Ports**: Each service in the stack exposes its own ports for communication and access.
3. **Volumes**: Volumes are mapped to persistent storage on the host to preserve configurations and data.

### Services in the Stack:
- **VPN**: 
  - Provides a secure NordVPN connection using NordLynx technology.
  - Configured to expose necessary ports for other services.
  - Healthcheck to monitor connectivity.

- **qBittorrent (ThrowTorrent)**:
  - Web UI access through port `8090` for managing torrents.
  - Runs behind the VPN network for secure downloading.

- **Overseerr**:
  - A media request system for managing media requests and interacting with Radarr and Sonarr.

- **Tautulli**:
  - A monitoring and analytics tool for Plex or Jellyfin media servers.

- **Jackett**:
  - A proxy server for accessing **torrent indexers** with support for various trackers.

- **Radarr**:
  - Automates the process of downloading movies through torrents.

- **Sonarr**:
  - Automates TV show downloads using torrents.

- **Flaresolverr**:
  - A CAPTCHA solving service for use with various torrent providers or media indexers.

## üìù Environment Variables

For each service, you'll need to modify the relevant **environment variables** to meet your needs.

- **VPN Container**:
  - `TOKEN=REDACTED`: Replace with your NordVPN API token.
  - `CONNECT=United_States`: Replace with the server you want to connect to.
  - `TECHNOLOGY=NordLynx`: Choose between **NordLynx** or **OpenVPN**.
  - `NETWORK=10.27.27.0/24`: Network range to allow access to. "Replace it with your own network range"

- **Other Services**:
  - Most services use `PUID`, `PGID`, and `TZ` environment variables for user permissions and timezone configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
2. Update the `TOKEN` environment variable with your NordVPN token.
3. Customize the port mapping and other environment variables as needed.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers.

## üìÑ Ports:
- `8090`: qBittorrent Web UI
- `5055`: Overseerr
- `8181`: Tautulli
- `9117`: Jackett
- `8989`: Sonarr
- `7878`: Radarr
- `8191`: Flaresolverr

## üîí Security Considerations:
- **VPN Usage**: All services are routed through the VPN container, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Port Exposure**: Only necessary ports are exposed. Adjust firewall rules to secure further.
- **Sensitive Data**: Ensure the NordVPN token is kept secure and not publicly exposed.
